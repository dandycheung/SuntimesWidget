> How are donations spent?

Money will be saved and periodically applied to the cost of development. It will be used to replace aging devices (phones, tablets, etc), and other necessary development tools.

As an example, my current (budget) Android phone was purchased using these funds, and I hope to eventually replace an aging laptop.

> How much has been collected?

Unfortunately choosing to pay for "free software" is relatively rare.<br/>
As of December 2023, after 7+ years of development (and a small purchase or two), the balance is just over $500.

Many people have given the "price of a binary" to help reach this amount. A few individuals have donated repeatedly, or given even more generously. Whatever the amount, I am very grateful to receive this money.
